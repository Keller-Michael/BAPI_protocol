# ðŸš¦ BAPI Protocol

A simple BAPI protocol class based on BAPIRET2 table. The basic idea is to escape the "primitive obsession" because most of the time people are just using a BAPIRET2 table instead of an object to work with BAPI messages.

## Basics

Class ZCL_BAPI_PROTOCOL implements two interfaces called ZIF_BAPI_PROTOCOL_WRITER and ZIF_BAPI_PROTOCOL_READER.
